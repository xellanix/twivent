## :scroll: How to use
There are two methods of using twibbon:
### 1. Automatic selection
- When a user visits the default [TwiVent][0] link, the system will automatically select the last twibbon in the [TwiProj] repository for later use by the user.

> [!WARNING]
> In this method there are restrictions on access to data on the server. Based on current policy, data access to the server is limited to 60 times per hour. The number of accesses is calculated on the server, so if there are 60 people accessing the data at the same hour, then the data will no longer be accessible until the next hour.

### 2. Based on the twibbon folder name (Recommended)
- In this method, the user needs to enter the name of the desired twibbon folder into the default TwiVent link, so the result will be like the one below. The twibbon folder name is obtained from the [TwiProj] repository.
```
https://xellanix.github.com/twivent/{TWIBBON_FOLDER_NAME}
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using the this method can provide benefits in the form of:
> 1. Ensure users use the right twibbon.
> 2. Avoid access limitation problems.
