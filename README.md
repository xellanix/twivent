## :question: QnA

### How do I make my twibbon usable by the public?
- To make twibbon available for public use, make sure you are a contributor to the [TwiProj][1] repository, so you can upload your twibbon there. So then, the system will automatically use the last twibbon on the list.

### How can I use the desired twibbon based on the folder name?
- To be able to use a particular twibbon (not using an automatic system), you need the folder name of the desired twibbon, which is found in the [TwiProj][1] repository. Then applied as below.
```
https://xellanix.github.com/twivent/{TWIBBON_FOLDER_NAME}
```

## :sparkles: Addition
- If you need additional information regarding managing folders and files related to the twibbon, please check the TwiProj [README][2]
